=====

This is a music player for the POKEY chip on Atari 8-bit systems.

It can play 4 voices simultaneously, but this requires configuring the POKEY to use 8-bit frequency divisors.
This reduces the pitch resolution, so to play in tune we must rapidly switch the divisor between two adjacent values every video frame.
